# OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that **organizes and models data and functionality into self-contained units called objects**. 

**Each object represents a real-world entity** and combines both data (attributes) and behavior (methods/functions) that operate on that data. 

OOP aims to provide a clear and structured way to design, create, and manage complex systems by promoting concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Mentioning various languages with support Object oriented programming:
1. C++
2. Java
3. Python
4. C sharp
5. Ruby
6. Kotlin
7. Javascript


In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class and an object are fundamental concepts that allow you to model and work with real-world entities and their behaviors in a structured manner.
