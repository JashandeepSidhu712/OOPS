# OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that **organizes and models data and functionality into self-contained units called objects**. 

**Each object represents a real-world entity** and combines both data (attributes) and behavior (methods/functions) that operate on that data. 

OOP aims to provide a clear and structured way to design, create, and manage complex systems by promoting concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Mentioning various languages with support Object oriented programming:
1. C++
2. Java
3. Python
4. C sharp
5. Ruby
6. Kotlin
7. Javascript


In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class and an object are fundamental concepts that allow you to model and work with real-world entities and their behaviors in a structured manner.

## CLASS
A class is a **blueprint or a template that defines the structure and behavior of objects**. 

It encapsulates the common attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will possess. 

In other words, **a class defines the properties and actions that its objects can have**. It serves as a blueprint for creating multiple instances of objects with similar characteristics.

## OBJECT
An object is an **instance of a class**. 

It is a concrete, tangible entity that embodies the attributes and behaviors defined by the class. 

Objects have their own unique data and can perform operations specified by the methods defined in their class. 

Each object is separate from others, even if they are of the same class, and can hold its own values for the class attributes.

### ANALOGY
Class "Car":

Attributes: Make, Model, Year, Color<br>
Methods: StartEngine(), Accelerate(), Brake()<br>

Object "Car1":

Make: Toyota<br>
Model: Camry<br>
Year: 2022<br>
Color: Blue<br>

Object "Car2":

Make: Ford<br>
Model: Mustang<br>
Year: 2021<br>
Color: Red<br>
