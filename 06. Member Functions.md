# MEMBER FUNCTION
Member functions are functions defined **within a class that operate on the class's data members** and **provide the behavior associated with the class**.

## WAYS TO DECLARE MEMBER FUNCTIONS:

### Inside the Class:
Member functions are often declared within the class definition using the function prototype. <br>
They can be defined within the class using inline definitions or later outside the class.

### Outside the Class:
Member functions can be defined outside the class using the scope resolution operator ::.

## Declaring Member Functions:
1. Declaration involves specifying the function's prototype (name, parameters, return type) without providing the implementation.
2. **Declaration is done within the class body.**
3. It allows you to **inform the compiler about the existence of the function**, enabling you to use the function elsewhere in the class or even in other classes.

## Defining Member Functions:
1. Definition involves **providing the actual implementation of the function**.
2. The function definition can also occur within the class body.
3. Defining the function within the class makes it an inline function, meaning the function's implementation is provided right where it's declared.
4. Alternatively, you can define the function outside the class using the class name and the scope resolution (::) operator.

## TYPES OF MEMBER FUNCTIONS:

#### Regular Member Functions:
Common member functions that operate on class data. <br>
Can be called on instances of the class.

#### Static Member Functions:
Belong to the class, not instances. <br>
Can be called using the class name. <br>
Cannot access instance-specific data.

#### Const Member Functions:
Indicate that the function won't modify the object's state. <br>
Can be called on constant objects.

#### Constructor Member Functions:
Initialize objects when they're created. <br>
No return type, have the same name as the class. <br>
Can have parameterized or default constructors.

#### Destructor Member Function:
Called when an object goes out of scope. <br>
Performs cleanup tasks like releasing resources.

#### Operator Overloading Functions:
Allows defining custom behaviors for operators. <br>
Named like operator+, operator==, etc.

## MEMBER FUNCTION OUTSIDE THE CLASS
To define a member function outside the class definition we have to use the scope resolution:: operator along with the class name and function name. 

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Solution
{
    int data;
    
    public:
    
    void getData(int data);
};
void Solution :: getData(int data)
{
    this->data = data;
    cout<<"data="<<data<<endl;
}
int main()
{
    Solution obj;
    
    obj.getData(10);
}
```
