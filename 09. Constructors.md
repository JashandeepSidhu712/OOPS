# CONSTRCTORS
Constructors are special member functions in a class that are automatically called when an object of the class is created. 

Their primary purpose is to initialize the object's data members and allocate any required resources. 

Constructors play a crucial role in setting up the initial state of objects and ensuring that they are ready for use.

1. Constructors are **called automatically when you create an object**. They set up the object before you use it.
2. Constructors **initialize the object's data members** to meaningful values.
3. Constructors have same name as the name of the class.
4. Constructors **don't have a return type**.
5. You can have **multiple constructors with different parameter lists** for versatility.
6. If you don't define any constructors, a **default constructor (with no parameters) is provided**.

## TYPES OF CONSTRUCTORS
1. Default Constructor
2. Non Parametrized Constructor
3. Parametrized Constructor
4. Copy Constructor

## DEAFULT CONSTRCTORS
It initializes the object's data members to their default values. If you don't define any constructors, the compiler automatically generates a default constructor.
