## INSTANCE
An instance refers to a specific occurrence or realization of a class, representing a unique object created based on that class.

Instances are used to **create unique objects based on a class blueprint**. 

They allow you to represent individual entities with their own specific characteristics and behaviors. Instances enable you to work with **multiple objects that share the same structure but have different data and behavior**.

## INSTANCE VARIABLE
An instance variable, also known as a member variable or attribute, is a variable that **holds unique data for each instance of a class, contributing to the state of the object**.

Instance variables store data specific to each instance of a class. They help define the state or attributes of an object. Instance variables allow objects to maintain their unique properties, enabling you to store and manage different values for different instances of a class.

## INSTANCE METHODS
Instance methods are functions defined within a class that **operate on the instance's data**, allowing objects to perform specific actions or provide functionalities associated with that class.

Instance methods are functions defined within a class that operate on instance variables and perform specific tasks related to the class's functionality. They encapsulate behaviors that instances can exhibit. These methods allow you to manipulate the data stored in instance variables and perform operations unique to each instance.

## PROGRAM

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Solution
{
    int data; //Instance variables
    
    public:
    
    void setData() //Instance method
    {
        cout<<"Enter data";
        cin>>data;
    }
    
    void getData()
    {
        cout<<data<<endl;
    }
};
int main()
{
    Solution obj1, obj2; //Creating instances (objects) of the Solution class 
    
    obj1.setData();
    obj1.getData();
    
    obj2.setData();
    obj2.getData();
}
```
