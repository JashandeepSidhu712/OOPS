# ENCAPSULATION
Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) that aims at **binding the data (attributes) and the methods (functions)** that operate on the data **into a single unit known as a class**.

##### Example for Encapsulation
Think of a company with different sections like finance, sales, etc. Each section has its own data and operations. <br>
Finance section manages financial data. <br>
Sales section manages sales data.<br>
If someone from the finance section needs specific sales data, they can't access it directly. Instead, they have to request it through proper channels.

The key idea behind encapsulation is to **hide the internal details of how the data is stored and processed**, and provide **controlled access** to that data through well-defined methods. 

This helps in achieving data protection, information hiding, and modularity in your codebase.

## Encapsulation also leads to data abstraction.

## GETTERS AND SETTER
Encapsulation encourages the use of getter and setter methods to access and modify private data members. 

**Getters provide read access**, while **setters provide write access**. 

This allows you to validate and control the data being set or retrieved.

## PROGRAM

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Solution
{
    int a, b;
    
    public:
    
    void setData(int a, int b) //setter method with arguments
    {
        this->a = a;
        this->b = b;
    }
    
    int getData() //getter method with return
    {
        return (a+b);
    }
};
int main()
{
    Solution obj;
    
    obj.setData(2, 3);
    
    cout<<obj.getData();
}
```

## PROPERTIES

### Data Hiding
Encapsulation prevents direct access to the internal data of a class from outside the class. <br>
Data members are usually marked as private to restrict direct modification.

### Access Control
By using access specifiers (private, protected, public), you control the visibility of members.

### Modularity
Encapsulation helps in creating modular code. Changes to the internal implementation of a class do not affect other parts of the code that use the class's public interface. This allows for easier maintenance and code updates.

### Data Validation
With encapsulation, you can include validation checks and safeguards within the setter methods. This ensures that the data being set adheres to certain constraints and maintains data integrity.

### Code Reusability
Encapsulation promotes code reusability. Once a class is encapsulated, you can reuse it in various parts of your program without worrying about the internal details.
