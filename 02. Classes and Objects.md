# CLASSES IN C++
Class is a **user-defined data type**, which **holds its own data members and member functions**, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.

Just like we have integer, string, float, similarly, class is also a data type. <br>
Let's understand with help of an example, <br>
Suppose we have, Apple, Orange, Banana <br>
All these can be classified into **Fruits** data type. <br>
Now, Fruits is class, which defines the properties like Color, taste, benefits, etc. of Apple, Banana, Orange.

A C++ class is like a **blueprint for an object**. <br>
It **defines the structure, properties** (data members), and **behavior** (member functions) that the objects of that class will have.

In other words, a class provides a **template that describes how an object should be created and what it can do**. Once you create an object based on a class, it inherits the characteristics and behaviors defined by the class

## DEFINING A CLASS
A class is defined in C++ using the keyword class followed by the name of the class. The body of the class is defined inside the curly brackets and terminated by a semicolon at the end.

```
class class_name
{
  Data Members;
  Member Function()
  {
  
  }
};
```

# OBJECTS IN C++
An Object is an **instance of a Class**. 

When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when **it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated**. 

When a class is defined in C++, it serves as a blueprint or a template for creating objects, but it doesn't allocate any memory for the actual data members or member functions of the class. It's only **when you create an instance of the class by instantiating an object that memory is allocated for that specific object's data members**.

## BREAK DOWN OF PROCESS 

**Class Definition**: When you define a class, you're essentially describing the structure, properties, and behaviors that objects of that class will have. This doesn't involve any memory allocation. It's just a blueprint.

**Object Instantiation**: When you create an object (an instance of the class), memory is allocated to store the data members defined in the class. The size of the memory allocated for an object is determined by the size of its data members.

As in example mentioned in Classes, Fruit is a class and Apple is an object.

# PROGRAM CODE

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Solution //class keyword to create a class named Solution
{
    int data_member; //data member in class
    // By default, private data member;
    
    public:
};
int main()
{
    Solution obj; // obj is the object of class Solution.  
    // Before its creation, no memory was allocated to the data members in the Solution class
    // only after its initialisation, memory is allocated;
}
```
