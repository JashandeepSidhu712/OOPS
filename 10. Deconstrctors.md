# DESTRCTORS
A destructor is a special member function in a class that is called when an object of that class goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. 

Destructors are used to perform cleanup tasks, release resources, and free memory that the object might have acquired during its lifetime. 

They are the counterpart to constructors, which initialize an object when it's created.

## PROPERTIES
1. A destructor is named the same as the class with a **tilde (~)** prefix.
2. Destructors **do not take any parameters**.
3. Destructors **do not have a return type** (not even void). 
4. They **can't be overloaded**, and you can only have **one destructor per class**.
5. You should define a destructor if your class allocates resources that need explicit cleanup, like dynamic memory allocation using new.

## PROGRAM

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Solution
{
    int n;
    int* arr;
    
    public:
    
    Solution(int n)
    {
        this->n = n;
        arr = new int[n];
        
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            cin>>arr[i];
        }
    }
    
    ~Solution()
    {
        delete[] arr;
    }
};
int main()
{
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    
    Solution obj(n);
}
```
